## Professional Summary

I am a PhD student in Bioinformatics & Genomics at Penn State University, passionate about applying machine learning and computational methods to solve problems in drug discovery and genomics.

My research interests include:

- Machine learning for drug discovery
- Deep learning in computational biology
- Structural bioinformatics
- Drug response prediction

## Research Background

I completed my M.Tech in Biotechnology from NIT Warangal with a focus on computational drug discovery, where I developed deep learning models for predicting drug sensitivity in breast cancer. My work has been published in journals including *Scientific Reports*, *Computers in Biology and Medicine*, and *Frontiers in Bioinformatics*.

Currently, I am working as a Project Associate at CSIR-CDRI, Lucknow, focusing on ML-based drug discovery targeting LDHC for non-hormonal male contraception.
