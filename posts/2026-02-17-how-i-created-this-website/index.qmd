## Introduction

As a PhD student in Bioinformatics & Genomics, I wanted a professional online presence that showcases both my CV and allows me to share insights about my research journey. After using Jekyll for my CV, I decided to modernize my website by converting it to Quarto. This post documents my migration process and explains why Quarto is an excellent choice for academic and research websites.

## Why I Chose Quarto

### The Original Setup: Jekyll

My CV was originally hosted using Jekyll and GitHub Pages. While Jekyll worked well for a static CV page, it had some limitations:

- Limited blog functionality without extensive configuration
- Requires Ruby dependencies
- Not as well-suited for technical content and code
- Less active development compared to newer frameworks

### Why Quarto?

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. Here's why I chose it:

1. **Better Blog Support**: Quarto has built-in blog functionality with automatic post discovery and listing pages
2. **Modern Framework**: Actively maintained by Posit (formerly RStudio) with regular updates
3. **Superior Technical Content**: Excellent support for code blocks, math equations, and scientific figures
4. **Seamless Integration**: Works perfectly with GitHub Actions for automated deployment
5. **R and Python Support**: As a computational biologist, I can easily embed R or Python code and output
6. **Multiple Output Formats**: Can generate websites, PDFs, presentations, and more from the same source

## The Migration Process

### Step 1: Setting Up Quarto Configuration

The heart of a Quarto website is the `_quarto.yml` configuration file. Here's what I configured:

```yaml
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: _site

website:
  title: "Anush Karampuri"
  description: "PhD Student in Bioinformatics & Genomics at Penn State University"

  navbar:
    left:
      - text: "CV"
        href: index.qmd
      - text: "Blog"
        href: posts.qmd
      - text: "About"
        href: about.qmd
    right:
      - icon: github
        href: https://github.com/AnushKarampuri00
      - icon: linkedin
        href: https://www.linkedin.com/in/anush-karampuri-31bb33199/

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    css: styles.css
```

Key configuration decisions:

- **Website type**: Quarto supports various project types (website, book, manuscript)
- **Output directory**: `_site/` for GitHub Pages compatibility
- **Theme**: Cosmo theme for a clean, professional look
- **Navigation**: Simple navbar with CV, Blog, and About sections
- **Social links**: GitHub and LinkedIn icons in the navbar

### Step 2: Converting the CV to Quarto Format

Converting my CV from `index.md` to `index.qmd` was straightforward:

1. **Renamed the file**: Changed `index.md` to `index.qmd`
2. **Added YAML front matter**:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "Curriculum Vitae"
   description: "PhD Student in Bioinformatics & Genomics at Penn State University"
   ---
   ```
3. **Kept all content intact**: Quarto supports standard Markdown and HTML, so my tables and `<details>` elements for expandable publications worked without modification

No significant content rewriting was needed, which made the migration smooth!

### Step 3: Creating the Blog Infrastructure

Setting up a blog in Quarto is remarkably simple:

**Blog Listing Page** (`posts.qmd`):
```yaml
---
title: "Blog"
description: "Thoughts on bioinformatics, machine learning, and computational biology"
listing:
  contents: posts
  sort: "date desc"
  type: default
  categories: true
---
```

The `listing` directive tells Quarto to automatically discover all posts in the `posts/` directory and display them in reverse chronological order. No manual configuration needed!

**Individual Posts**: Each post lives in its own directory with an `index.qmd` file:
```
posts/
└── 2026-02-17-how-i-created-this-website/
    └── index.qmd
```

This structure keeps each post self-contained and makes it easy to include images or other assets.

### Step 4: About Page

I created an `about.qmd` page with:

- Professional summary
- Research interests
- Contact information
- Links to CV and blog

This gives visitors context about who I am and what I do.

### Step 5: Custom Styling

While Quarto's default themes are excellent, I added a `styles.css` file for minor customizations:

- Improved table readability
- Styled the `<details>` elements for publications
- Enhanced heading spacing

Custom CSS is optional but allows fine-tuning the design to match your preferences.

### Step 6: GitHub Actions for Automated Deployment

The most powerful part of this setup is automated deployment using GitHub Actions. I created `.github/workflows/publish.yml`:

```yaml
name: Publish Quarto Website

on:
  push:
    branches: main

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Quarto
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2

      - name: Render Quarto Project
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/render@v2

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
```

This workflow:

1. Triggers on every push to the main branch
2. Sets up Quarto in the GitHub Actions environment
3. Renders the entire project
4. Uploads the built site as an artifact
5. Deploys to GitHub Pages

**Important**: You need to configure GitHub Pages to use "GitHub Actions" as the source (not "Deploy from a branch") in your repository settings.

### Step 7: Final Touches

I also updated `.gitignore` to exclude Quarto build artifacts:

```
/_site/
/.quarto/
```

This keeps the repository clean by not tracking generated files.

## The Final Result

After implementing all these steps, I now have:

- **Professional CV**: Clean, well-organized CV as the homepage
- **Blog Platform**: Easy-to-use blog for sharing research insights
- **Automated Deployment**: Push to GitHub, and the site updates automatically
- **Modern Design**: Clean, responsive layout with the Cosmo theme
- **Future-Ready**: Can easily add more features like search, RSS feeds, or additional pages

## Quarto Project Structure

Here's what the final directory structure looks like:

```
/workspaces/CV/
├── _quarto.yml              # Main configuration
├── index.qmd                # CV (homepage)
├── about.qmd                # About page
├── posts.qmd                # Blog listing
├── posts/
│   └── 2026-02-17-how-i-created-this-website/
│       └── index.qmd        # This post!
├── styles.css               # Custom styling
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── publish.yml      # Deployment workflow
├── .gitignore
└── _site/                   # Generated (ignored by git)
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Quarto is powerful yet simple**: The learning curve is gentle, especially if you're familiar with Markdown
2. **GitHub Actions integration is seamless**: Automated deployment works reliably
3. **Perfect for academics**: Quarto's focus on scientific and technical content makes it ideal for researchers
4. **Extensible**: Easy to add new features like RSS feeds, search, or custom pages
5. **Migration is straightforward**: Converting from Jekyll required minimal changes to existing content

## Next Steps

Now that the website is set up, I plan to:

- Write posts about my bioinformatics research
- Share tutorials on machine learning for drug discovery
- Document interesting problems and solutions I encounter
- Add search functionality and RSS feeds
